## So, what am I up to now?
Capricorn Season is over, but the hustle isn't. I've got a couple of things I'm working on:

1. **My 2025 Resolution is to cook a soup a week.** I should be making a Saffron Winter Soup with Salt Cod right now,
   but for some reason, I don't feel like peeling potatoes. But I'll get to it soon.

   My resolutions for the past few years have all been food related. I cut out fast food, reduced sugars, and now I'm
   focusing on how much I spend or delivery.
2. **Spending some time focusing on this site.** I've had about three-or-four iterations of this site in my life. Before
   now, the furthest I ever got was a couple portfolio pieces that didn't justify the time it took to set up the CMS.
   Last year I stumbled upon the concept of a Digital Garden and that's shifted my perspective of what a website could
   be. Which is great considering how volatile the social media landscape can be. 

   I also came across the idea of "slash pages", like [/now](/now) and [/uses](/uses) that feels like holding membership
   into a niche online community.
3. **Content creation.** I've been talking about getting back into posting videos for years now. Back '08/'09 I used to
   post random obnoxious videos to YouTube, but fell off after I read a hate comment. My ego was bruised and I felt
   embarrassed, but now I feel like I've matured enough to see the platforms for what they are, and what they can be.
   
   I have a lot of ideas, but for now I think it's best to go easy and explore when inspiration strikes.
