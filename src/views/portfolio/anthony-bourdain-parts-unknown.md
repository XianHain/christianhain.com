needed a distinctive look and feel.

Working on the development side of these two pages (a show page and an episode

done was add new functionality for new datatypes, and we're rockin' and rollin'.
Responsive design required more thought and patience, however.

In the end, we launched a beautiful site using the latest in HTML 5 and CSS 3
techniques, focused on graceful degradation to support legacy browsers, and made
sure the pages were fully functional on any available device.
